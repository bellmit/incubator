Where did time go? Four years flies and today I am feeling so sorry to say goodbye.
Today is not Thanksgiving but I have to give sincere thanks to all of you for the helps in the past four years.

For the last four years,probably I cann't say that I succeeded here but working here was an important good experience in my life which is worthy to talk about with my family and friends, and most importantly I met all of you and the good relationship on which I cann't place a price tag.

As usual,farewells always make me feeling sad and I hope we could meet and work together someday. :)
