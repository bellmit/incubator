Dear Colleagues,

As many of you will move to the new office(3F, Blk 5), we’d like to notify you some info regarding printers in the new office .
For consistent user experience, we deployed 2 all-in-one printers in BLK5 office, which are the same model(RICOH Aficio MP C5000 PCL 6) as what we’re having now in BLK8 office.

Please refer to attached instruction (Printer_Installation_Instruction_Shenzhen_Blk5.pdf)  to install the printers.
·         For Windows Users, it’s just about unzipping and running attached script (inst_print_x64_Shenzhen_Blk5.zip).
·         For Mac OS X Users, please follow steps in the instruction.

We also provide user manual beside the printers.  If you have any questions or need help, please contact:
